Here are some simple examples to let you get started quickly with JRuyi. However, to understand JRuyi better, it's necessary to get some knowledge of [OSGi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) first.

Throughout this whole Getting Started, $JRUYI_HOME is used to refer to the installation directory (home directory) of JRuyi. Please see [here]({{ site.url }}/userguide/installation) for how to install JRuyi.

All the examples are given under a UNIX-like environment. It should be very straightforward for you to make them work on Windows.
